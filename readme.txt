first we will install react router dom. we will use command npm install react-router-dom. 
once it is installed we can check it in the package.json file. 
we will remove extra code to start working on our own project. 
Next we will create components folder and different components in it like home, contact, privacy login info. 
then import all of them in appjs file. use them in browser router routes route.
create a navbar, import link and use it in navbar and use navbar in main app js file. when we click on text 
in navbar, it should move to that page. as we use a href="" in html but we use link to="" in react instead 
of a tag. 

to add icons, we can use material ui or other websites. use command from material ui website npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
to install it
